## Description

- To edit and clean up the semantics in the HTML annd CSS of the Develop file.
- To learn how to make the code work with more direct instuctions.
- How to excute a file with least amount of confusion
- I learend that sometimes you don't need a class if it is exactly a header or a footer.  Also that if you change some of the <div's to something more specific then just a random section element.

## Credits

I was helped by 2 of my classmates
Jenn Butler and Chase Chambers.
I also did a session with the ASKBCS and they helped me discover that I had too many git folders and I could get the Repo to work due to not being able to know where to go. 
They were explaining to me about why I made the changes in the CSS files. And HTML.
I was told that classes need id's and that you can only use header and footer and not make up one.
